## üìä Known Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Linear Programming in Swift
**Problem**: JavaScript `javascript-lp-solver` library doesn't exist in Swift
**Solutions**:
- Option A: Use Accelerate framework's BLAS/LAPACK for matrix operations
- Option B: Use third-party Swift optimization library (e.g., SwiftNumerics)
- Option C: Port the simplex algorithm from JS to Swift manually
- Option D: Hybrid approach - use heuristic search instead of pure LP

**Recommendation**: Start with Option D (heuristic), add proper LP later if needed

### Challenge 2: Complex Calculation Algorithm
**Problem**: helper.js has 500+ lines of intertwined calculation logic
**Solutions**:
- Break into small, testable functions
- Use TDD approach (write tests first based on known recipes)
- Cross-validate with web version using same inputs

### Challenge 3: Large Dataset Performance
**Problem**: 60+ fillings, 22 condiments, 151+ recipes, 150+ meals
**Solutions**:
- Index data structures for O(1) lookups
- Use lazy loading for images
- Implement efficient filtering (pre-computed indexes)
- Debounce search/recalculation

### Challenge 4: Ingredient Image Loading
**Problem**: Images are hosted on external URLs (serebii.net)
**Solutions**:
- Download and bundle images locally
- Implement caching layer for network images
- Use placeholder images for failed loads
- Consider legal/permission for redistribution

## üìù Notes

### Data Consolidation Status
- Using `sv-sandwich-builder/source-data/` as primary data source (cleaner structure)
- Algorithm logic from `pokemon-sandwich-simulator/src/helper/helper.js`
- Cross-reference both sources to ensure data completeness

### TCA Best Practices
- Keep features small and focused
- Use `@Dependency` for services (DataLoader, Calculator, etc.)
- Implement `Equatable` on State for performance
- Use `EffectTask` for async operations
- Write tests for all reducers

### Performance Targets
- Calculation: < 100ms for any sandwich
- Optimization: < 2s for complex searches
- Data load: < 500ms on first launch
- UI responsiveness: 60fps scrolling
